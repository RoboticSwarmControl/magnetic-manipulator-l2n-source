This repository contains 

1.) detailed CAD drawings and a bill-of-materials for constructing a 6-coil electromagnetic setup.
The working volume is a sphere with radius 0.075 m. The system is composed of six copper coils arranged in a cubical shape. Each coil is placed and held in an independent cryostats. The cryostats contain the LN2 and were built using G10. 

2.) Matlab code for simulating the system

3.) LabVIEW code for running the hardware
